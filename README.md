# WooPies-Final-Project
This is the final project for the Promineo Tech Back End Developer Course. It's a web-based API design using Spring Boot and it is all about pies. 
WooPies: A web-based pie shop where you can order pies from the comfort of your home! WooPies prides itself on homemade pies that are so good you'll say, "Woopie!".
Ideally, the WooPies web-based API allows CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on each entity within the project. Currently, the Pie entity is capable of full CRUD operations while the Customers, Address, and Orders entities are buggy and need some TLC. 
This project will continue to be worked with the goal of performing CRUD operations on all entities while updating foreign keys with each entity update.
